CATLib for Spatial Problems

This repository groups experiments being performed about applying CATLib to spatial problems, e.g., synthesising a strategy 
enforcing spatial properties on a topological graph.

## Video demo
A video demo created using this repository is available at https://youtu.be/08_iok6R9sw.
Each frame of the video has been generated by executing the code in  AppVideoComposition.java
and by incrementing the bound of the call to the composition method. 

All frames are stored in the folder src/test/ ... /resources/video.


## Miscellanea

The JSONConverter for importing graphs of <a href="https://github.com/vincenzoml/VoxLogicA">VoxLogicA</a> encoding bitmap images has been moved into this repository.
A PngConverter is also available for directly importing png images as automata, by-passing the JSon representation.
